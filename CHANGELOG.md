CHANGELOG
=========

v0.7.1
------
* Eliminate extra slash in S3 filename. [Issue](https://github.com/mapzen/tilequeue/pull/65).
* Update `make_queue` signature to support sending items to the queue for rendering when a request for a tile which hasn't been rendered before is received. [Issue](https://github.com/mapzen/tilequeue/pull/66) as part of [larger issue](https://github.com/mapzen/tile-tasks/issues/39).

v0.7.0
------
* WOF neighbourhoods with inception and cessation dates are now respected, with those features being hidden from tiles. [Issue](https://github.com/mapzen/tilequeue/issues/59).
* The WOF update process is now robust to intermittent HTTP errors. This could help if you've been experiencing occasional WOF update failures. [Issue](https://github.com/mapzen/vector-datasource/tilequeue/60).

v0.6.1
------
* Made the WOF processor robust to missing `lbl:longitude` and `lbl:latitude` properties by falling back to the geometry's position. This isn't as good as the label position, but better than erroring.

v0.6.0
------
* Added a date prefix to be used to distinguish between different versions of the tiles in the store. This means it's not necessary to create a new bucket for each release.
* Added a hash prefix for files stored in an S3 bucket. This is recommended practice for distributing load for a bucket across an S3 cluster.

v0.5.1
------
* Move reproject_lnglat_to_mercator function for outside usage

v0.5.0
------
* Configure better defaults in sample config
* Add WOF neighbourhood processing
  - add command to load initial neighbourhoods to database
  - add command to track updates
* Create abstraction to factor out threaded enqueueing

v0.4.1
------
* Add bbox_intersection filter for Jinja, which allows clipping to the query bounding box.

v0.4.0
------
* Convert post process config into a list, to support generating dynamic `label_placement`s for more than one input layer.

v0.3.0
------
* Add read_tile to store interface

0.2.0
-----
* Stable
